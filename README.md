## Description
Tablature notation is a way of writing down an instrumentâ€™s parts in an accessible manner. The tablature in the context of this project will refer to guitar tablature. Although tablature is widely used for its ease of use, most tabs exist in a text format, and there does not exist an easy way to turn guitar tab text into a more featured digital file format.

The software product will consist of a desktop application. Upon the upload of a tablature in *.txt form, the system will convert the tab to a MusicXML file format.
